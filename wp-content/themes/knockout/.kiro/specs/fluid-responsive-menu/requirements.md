# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the implementation of a fluid responsive design system for the menu page that provides pixel-perfect scaling across all device breakpoints. The system will use modern CSS techniques including CSS variables, clamp() functions, and mobile-first responsive design to ensure optimal user experience from mobile devices (480px) to ultra-wide displays (1920px+).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Responsive Grid System

**User Story:** As a user viewing the menu on any device, I want the menu items to be displayed in an optimal grid layout that maximizes screen real estate while maintaining readability and usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport is 1920px or wider THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 6-column grid layout
2. WHEN the viewport is between 1440px-1919px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 5-column grid layout
3. WHEN the viewport is between 1200px-1439px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 5-column compact grid layout
4. WHEN the viewport is between 992px-1199px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 5-column grid layout
5. WHEN the viewport is between 768px-991px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 4-column touch-friendly grid layout
6. WHEN the viewport is between 640px-767px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 4-column grid with vertical card layouts and centered text
7. WHEN the viewport is between 481px-639px THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 3-column grid layout
8. WHEN the viewport is 480px or smaller THEN the system SHALL display menu items in a 2-column grid with minimal padding

### Requirement 2: Fluid Component Scaling

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want all UI components to scale smoothly and proportionally so that the interface remains visually consistent and functional across all screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing component scaling THEN the system SHALL use CSS variables and clamp() functions for fluid scaling
2. WHEN scaling menu filter buttons THEN padding SHALL scale from 1rem to 0.4rem across breakpoints
3. WHEN scaling menu filter buttons THEN font size SHALL scale from 0.9rem to 0.6rem across breakpoints
4. WHEN scaling menu filter buttons THEN border radius SHALL scale from 30px to 15px across breakpoints
5. WHEN scaling category headers THEN title font size SHALL scale from 2.5rem to 1.3rem across breakpoints
6. WHEN scaling category headers THEN icon size SHALL scale from 3rem to 1.8rem across breakpoints
7. WHEN scaling menu cards THEN padding SHALL scale from 2.5rem to 1rem across breakpoints
8. WHEN scaling menu cards THEN border radius SHALL scale from 20px to 10px across breakpoints
9. WHEN viewport is below 767px THEN menu cards SHALL switch to vertical layout using flex-direction: column

### Requirement 3: Typography Scaling

**User Story:** As a user reading menu content, I want all text to remain legible and properly sized regardless of my device screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scaling item numbers THEN size SHALL scale from 50px to 30px across breakpoints
2. WHEN scaling item names THEN font size SHALL scale from 1.5rem to 0.9rem across breakpoints
3. WHEN scaling item prices THEN font size SHALL scale from 1.8rem to 1.1rem across breakpoints
4. WHEN displaying any text THEN line-height SHALL be at least 1.4 for readability
5. WHEN text is displayed on mobile devices THEN it SHALL remain readable without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 4: Layout Constraints and Performance

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the menu interface to load quickly and display properly without layout shifts or stretching issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying menu cards THEN the system SHALL use max-width constraints to prevent stretching
2. WHEN implementing grid layouts THEN gaps SHALL scale fluidly using viewport width units
3. WHEN displaying cards on mobile THEN vertical layouts SHALL use flex-direction: column
4. WHEN implementing the design THEN CSS variables SHALL be used for all theme properties
5. WHEN writing CSS THEN mobile-first media queries SHALL be used
6. WHEN implementing styles THEN no !important overrides SHALL be used
7. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no layout shifts or content jumping

### Requirement 5: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user on any browser or device, I want the menu to display and function consistently regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the implementation THEN it SHALL work correctly on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. WHEN testing on mobile devices THEN it SHALL work correctly on iOS and Android
3. WHEN using CSS features THEN fallbacks SHALL be provided for older browsers
4. WHEN implementing animations THEN they SHALL degrade gracefully on low-performance devices

### Requirement 6: Maintainability and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this system, I want clear documentation and extensible code structure so I can easily add new breakpoints or modify existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivering the implementation THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be provided
2. WHEN structuring the code THEN it SHALL be organized for easy future breakpoint extensions
3. WHEN implementing CSS THEN it SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN creating the system THEN it SHALL include examples of how to add new breakpoints
5. WHEN documenting the system THEN it SHALL include performance optimization guidelines

### Requirement 7: Priority Implementation Order

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the implementation to prioritize the most commonly used device sizes to ensure maximum user impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN Mobile (480px) breakpoint SHALL be implemented first
2. WHEN Mobile is complete THEN Tablet (640px) breakpoint SHALL be implemented second
3. WHEN Tablet is complete THEN Desktop Small (992px) breakpoint SHALL be implemented third
4. WHEN Desktop Small is complete THEN Ultra Wide (1920px+) breakpoint SHALL be implemented fourth
5. WHEN each breakpoint is implemented THEN it SHALL be tested before proceeding to the next

### Requirement 8: CSS Variable System

**User Story:** As a developer customizing the theme, I want a centralized variable system so I can easily modify design properties without hunting through multiple CSS files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the CSS THEN root variables SHALL be defined for all scalable properties
2. WHEN defining variables THEN card-padding SHALL use clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2.5rem)
3. WHEN defining variables THEN title-size SHALL use clamp(1.3rem, 3vw, 2.5rem)
4. WHEN defining variables THEN border-radius SHALL use clamp(10px, 1.5vw, 30px)
5. WHEN using variables THEN they SHALL be consistently applied throughout the stylesheet
6. WHEN variables are changed THEN the entire design SHALL update proportionally
